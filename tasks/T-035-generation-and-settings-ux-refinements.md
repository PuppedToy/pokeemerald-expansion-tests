# T-035 — Generation + Settings UX refinements

## Context

Owner feedback batch after T-034. Mix of frontend + a little backend (cancel a build, delete account, realistic ETA).

## Plan

1. The step-3 bottom button is **"Cancel"** before/while the ROM is generating (click → confirm
   "Are you sure? This is permanent" → cancels the run). It's **"Start over"** only once downloaded.
2. ROM generated but not downloaded → button is **"Start over"** but **disabled**, tooltip
   "Download your ROM to start over."
3. **Download ROM** button gets a distinctive emerald-green colour unused elsewhere in the kit.
4. A red **Delete account permanently** button in Settings, with an "are you sure? irreversible" confirm.
5. During the whole process, a **collapsed disclosure** at the bottom with the run details — the exact
   step-2 "Review" content, **reusing the same render** (no duplicated code).
6. The **"Building your ROM…"** state shows the **exact ETA** (minutes remaining), counting down.
7. The single-use warning needs **more emphasis** (it's too subtle now).

Backend: `POST /api/cancel` (cancel the active request), `DELETE /api/account` (delete user + cascade
their requests/runs/tokens, FKs are not ON DELETE CASCADE), and a realistic `AVG_ROM_SECS` default so
the ETA/bar are meaningful.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Bottom button: Cancel (+confirm) pre/at build; Start-over disabled (tooltip) when ready-not-downloaded; Start-over when downloaded.
- [ ] Download ROM is emerald green.
- [ ] Settings has a red delete-account button with an irreversible-confirm; the account + its data are removed.
- [ ] A collapsed run-details disclosure shows the Review content (shared render) throughout step 3.
- [ ] Building shows an ETA countdown in minutes.
- [ ] The single-use warning is visually emphasised.
- [ ] randomizer + backend suites green; owner visual review.

## Progress log

- **2026-06-29** — Created from owner feedback batch. Implementing backend (cancel/delete/eta) first, then the 7 UI points.

- **2026-06-29** — All 7 implemented. **Backend:** `POST /api/cancel` (marks the active request
  `failed` + deletes its files; frees the slot — `requests.cancel`), `DELETE /api/account` (cascades
  requests+files/runs/tokens then the user, transactional — FKs aren't ON DELETE CASCADE), and
  `AVG_ROM_SECS` default bumped 15→270 s so ETA/bar are realistic. Tests: handleCancel ×2 +
  account-delete ×2 → **backend 90/90**. **Frontend:** (1/2) the gen-done bottom button is Cancel
  (+confirm) pre/at build, disabled "Start over" when ready-not-downloaded, "Start over" when
  delivered (`setStartOverBtn` + a wired handler + `clearRun` that drops the IndexedDB bundle &
  delivered flag; app.js `onStartOver` resets the wizard). (3) Download ROM is `.btn-emerald`. (4) red
  Delete-account button in Settings + confirm + `DELETE /api/account`. (5) a collapsed "Run details"
  `<details>` reusing `reviewRowsHtml` (shared with step-2 Review — no dup). (6) Building shows an ETA
  countdown driven by the same timer as the bar. (7) single-use warning is now an emphasised callout.
  JS syntax-validated; randomizer 470/470. **Not deployed** (owner-gated). Pending owner visual review.
